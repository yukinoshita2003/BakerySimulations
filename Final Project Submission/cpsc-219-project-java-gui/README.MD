## Data Tracker

Tracks orders for 4 different types of cake, and allows for the user to add, modify, and view details about each order.

## Run Commands

For the .jar file:
java --module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar CakeTracker.jar

The module path may be different for other users, but the path needs to allow the program to access the JavaFX SDK libraries.
You can also append a file as an argument for the program to load by default on startup.
